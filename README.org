A tiny library that gathers synonyms for a word using the amazing
[[https://wordnet.princeton.edu/][Wordnet]].

For example:

#+begin_src elisp
(wordnet-find-synonyms "systems")

; => ("systems" "system" "scheme" "system of rules" "arrangement" "organization" "organisation")
#+end_src


Currently I use this for better searching my notes (i.e., look at the
command =wordnet-insert-synoyms-last-word-for-ag=).
